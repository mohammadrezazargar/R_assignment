I was able to clone your repository and run the Rmd file easily.
the outcome files were correct. 
also plots are generated perfectly. The only problem about plots is that 10 is after 1 not after 9.
you can use this code to address the problem:

# calculate SNPs by group and chromosome
snps_by_group <- all_snps %>%
  group_by(Chromosome, Group) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

```

```{r}
# Ensure chromosomes are ordered correctly
snps_by_group$Chromosome <- factor(snps_by_group$Chromosome, 
                                   levels = as.character(1:10))

# SNP comparison between maize and teosinte
ggplot(snps_by_group, aes(x = Chromosome, y = count, fill = Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "SNPs per chromosome by group",
       x = "Chromosome",
       y = "Number of SNPs",
       fill = "Group") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
